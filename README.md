# LSUS-RectangleInheritance

Purpose:

    This Java code was an assignment for CSC 145 exam 3 and showcase my programming skills in Java by implementing a custom MyRectangle class. The project was created based on the provided TODO statements and guiding comments from the professor. I was responsible for figuring out the solutions to complete the implementation.

Key Features:

    Extends the Built-in Rectangle Class: The MyRectangle class inherits from the standard Java java.awt.Rectangle class, expanding its functionality.
    Custom Constructors: Two constructors allow you to create MyRectangle objects using either two Point objects or four integer coordinates.
    Scaling: The scaleIt methods enable versatile scaling of the rectangle on either one or both axes.
    Area and Perimeter Calculations: Provides methods for calculating the area (getArea) and perimeter (getPerimeter) of a MyRectangle.
    Combined and Intersect Area: Calculates the combined area (getCombinedArea) and intersection area (getIntersectArea) of two rectangles.
    Intersection Percentage: Determines the percentage of area shared by two overlapping rectangles (getPercentIntersect).
    Touching Rectangles: Determines if two rectangles are touching along an edge (touching)
    Orientation and Shape Detection: Checks if a rectangle is in landscape orientation (isLandscape) or is a square (isSquare).

How to Use (For Demonstration Only):

This code is intended for showcasing programming concepts, not real-world application. Here's how it's used within the Main class:

    Create MyRectangle objects: Rectangles with different coordinates are defined.
    Scale the rectangle: The scaleIt method is applied.
    Perform calculations: The various methods are executed to demonstrate calculations of area, perimeter, combined area, intersection, etc.
    Output Results: Calculated values are printed to the console.

Notes:

    The provided TODO statements and professor's comments guided the code's development.
    Pay attention to how the MyRectangle class leverages the existing functionality of the java.awt.Rectangle class to streamline its methods.
